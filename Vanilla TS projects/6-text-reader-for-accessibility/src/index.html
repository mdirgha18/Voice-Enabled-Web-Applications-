          🧡 A Story Behind the Reader "Let Every Voice Be Heard, Let Every Word
          Be Understood" Once upon a screen, in a world flooded with words,
          there lived countless voices waiting to be heard—not by others, but by
          themselves. People with visual challenges, attention difficulties, and
          reading fatigue often stood on the margins, left to scroll silently
          through oceans of text. The web had grown louder, but for many, the
          signal was still silent. That’s when the idea sparked: What if the web
          could speak back? Enter the Text Reader for Accessibility—a gentle
          companion designed not to replace reading, but to restore access,
          empower choice, and give voice to words. With the simple tap of a
          finger or the sound of your voice, this app springs to life,
          transforming static paragraphs into spoken dialogue, and transforming
          silence into understanding. You highlight a passage about faraway
          lands, and it begins to narrate. You say “pause” and the story waits
          with you. You say “resume” and it flows again—like a friend picking up
          where they left off. No more squinting. No more skimming. Just a calm
          voice, clear intention, and the freedom to hear the web the way you
          need it. Because accessibility isn’t an add-on. It’s a birthright. A
          design choice. A story worth telling. And this app? It’s one small
          chapter in a much bigger story— Where every word is not just
          written... but heard.
